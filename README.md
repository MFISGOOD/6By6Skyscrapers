# 6By6Skyscrapers
Skyscrapers is a building placing puzzle based on an NxN grid with some clues along its sides. The object is to place a skyscraper in each square, with a height between 1 and N, so that no two skyscrapers in a row or column have the same number of floors. In addition, the number of visible skyscrapers, as viewed from the direction of each clue, is equal to the value of the clue. Note that higher skyscrapers block the view of lower skyscrapers located behind them. In the example below we have a 6x6 Skyscrapers puzzle with six columns and six rows. We now need to place 1-floor to 6-floor skyscrapers in each row and column according to the above rulesâ€¦ but how?

    The height of the skyscrapers is between 1 and 6
    No two skyscrapers in a row or column may have the same number of floors
    A clue is the number of skyscrapers that you can see in a row or column from the outside
    Higher skyscrapers block the view of lower skyscrapers located behind them
